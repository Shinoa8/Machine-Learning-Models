## Introduction

Machine learning models are implemented using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for exploring and understanding different machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Models

- [Linear Regression](LinearRegression/Linear_regression.ipynb): Implementation of linear regression using Scikit-Learn.
- [Logistic Regression](LogisticRegression/Logistic_regression.ipynb): Implementation of Logistic regression using Scikit-Learn.


## Getting Started

To get started with any specific model, navigate to its directory and just Run it

### Clone the repository
